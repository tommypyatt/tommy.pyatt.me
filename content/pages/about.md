title: About Me
---

I'm a front-end web developer based in Manchester. Here’s a little about me.

I’ve been working in e-commerce since 2012, primarily with Adobe Commerce (formerly Magento). Over the years, I’ve gained extensive hands-on experience with a range of front-end frameworks and tools, including Backbone, Knockout, React, Redux, SASS, Handlebars, Gulp, and Webpack. I’m not tied to any particular technology stack and enjoy learning new tools as they evolve — though I’ve found React to be especially rewarding to work with.

I care deeply about writing clean, maintainable code — code that others can easily understand, extend, and trust. My goal isn’t just to make something work or fix a bug, but to produce solutions that genuinely improve the system as a whole and help others take pride in their own work as well.

I try to keep things simple — partly because I know my human limitations, but also because I’ve learned that complexity should only be introduced when it’s truly warranted.

There are a few things I consider essential: version control (I’m a firm believer in Git), solid issue tracking (Jira or similar), and clear, consistent communication within the team.

I make mistakes from time to time — and I make a point of learning from them.

I believe strongly in modularity and separation of concerns; they’re the foundation for flexible, long-lasting software.
